# SpotifySongRecommender
The purpose of this project is to build a model using scraped Spotify API data in order to recommend me songs in the form of like or disliking a song.

## Version 1.0
This version was put in place as a base for building off of. This first model was 57% accurate which is not ideal. Analysis of the model and data made it understood that a bigger sample size and more information on observations may be a big benefit. Inclusion of artists and release year might increase model accuracy. Logistic regression model was only one built in this version, but as more work gets put into scraping data increase in model variation will be used.
